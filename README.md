# CRM REST API

## Description

This repository contains a RESTful CRM (Customer Relationship Management) API built with Laravel. The main purpose of the project is to provide a backend service that allows companies to manage their clients and the activities associated with them, while supporting secure user authentication and authorization.

The API is designed to be stateless, JSON-based, and easily consumable by web or mobile frontends. Each authenticated user can manage their own data, ensuring separation and security between company employees.

## Project Overview

The project is implemented as a Laravel application following REST and clean architecture principles. Instead of traditional server-rendered views, all interactions are performed through HTTP endpoints that return JSON responses.

Key goals of the project:

* Centralize client information for a company
* Track activities related to each client
* Provide secure authentication for users
* Expose a clear and versioned REST API
* Maintain a clean, scalable, and testable codebase

## Architecture

The application is structured around a layered architecture inspired by Domain-Driven Design (DDD):

### Controllers (HTTP Layer)

* Handle incoming HTTP requests
* Validate request intent and format
* Delegate business logic to the Application layer
* Return standardized JSON responses

### Application Layer

* Contains use cases and services
* Coordinates domain logic
* Acts as an intermediary between Controllers and Domain logic

### Domain Layer

* Represents the core business logic
* Contains domain events and entities
* Is independent of framework-specific details

### Infrastructure

* Database access via Eloquent ORM
* Authentication and authorization mechanisms
* Configuration and environment setup

## Authentication

Authentication is handled using token-based security suitable for REST APIs.

* OAuth2-based authentication using Laravel Passport
* Users authenticate via a login endpoint
* A valid access token is required to access protected endpoints
* Tokens are sent using the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

This approach ensures the API remains stateless and secure.

## Database Design

The database is intentionally simple and normalized. It consists of the following main entities:

* **Users**: Application users who authenticate and perform actions
* **Clients**: Customers managed by users
* **Activities**: Actions or events associated with a client

Relationships:

* A User can have many Clients
* A Client belongs to a User
* A Client can have many Activities
* An Activity belongs to both a Client and a User

Migrations and seeders are provided to simplify setup and local development.

## API Versioning

The API is versioned to ensure backward compatibility:

* Base path: `/api/v1`

All current endpoints are grouped under version 1, allowing future versions to coexist without breaking existing integrations.

## Mailing and Events

The project includes support for domain events and notifications:

* Domain events are triggered on relevant actions (e.g. client creation, activity registration)
* The structure allows easy extension for email notifications or asynchronous processing
* The system is ready to be integrated with external mailing services if required

## Technologies Used

## Development Notes

* Controllers are kept thin and focused on HTTP concerns
* Business logic is encapsulated in service classes
* Domain events decouple side effects from core logic
* The codebase follows Laravel and REST best practices
* The project is designed to be easily extendable
